# EFT Skill Detection Guide

Basic greetings and small talk will NOT trigger EFT detection.
## Messages that will NOT trigger EFT detection:
- "Hello, how are you both doing today?"
- "How was your week?"
- "What brings you here today?"
- "Nice to meet you"
- "How are you feeling?"

## Messages that will trigger EFT detection:

### Cycle De-escalation
- "I notice you both seem frustrated. Let me help you understand the pattern that's happening between you two."
- "Let's slow this down for a moment. I can see this is getting heated."
- "It sounds like you're caught in a cycle where the same interactions keep repeating."

### Restructuring Interactions
- "It sounds like you're feeling hurt underneath that anger. Can you tell your partner what you really need from them right now?"
- "I can see you're trying to protect yourself. What would it be like to share that vulnerable feeling with your partner?"

### Consolidation
- "I want you both to notice what just happened. You were able to share your feelings without attacking each other."
- "This is a new way of communicating for you both. How does it feel to connect like this?"

## If you want to test the EFT detection:

1. Start with a greeting (left panel will show "No EFT skill detected" )
2. Use one of the therapeutic interventions above
3. The left panel should now show:
