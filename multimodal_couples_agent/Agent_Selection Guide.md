# How to Choose Which Agent to Talk To

three buttons:

- **Both** - Talk to Alpha and Beta at the same time (this is the default)
- **Alpha** - Talk only to Alpha (the partner who tends to pursue and demand)
- **Beta** - Talk only to Beta (the partner who tends to withdraw and avoid)

Sample to ask both:
- "how are you both doing?"
- "what brings you both here"

Sample to ask alpha:
- "Alpha, what are you feeling underneath that frustration?"
- "Alpha, what happens inside when Beta goes quiet?"
-  "Alpha, what's the scared part of you trying to say?"
-  "Alpha, can you tell Beta what you need in a gentler way?"


Sample to ask beta:
- "Beta, what's happening for you right now?"
- "Beta, what makes you want to pull away?"
- "Beta, what would you like Alpha to know?"
- "Beta, what do you need when things get intense?"
